Manual Testing of UI and API
All the bug reports are located in Issues tab (https://github.com/zhanarkaliyeva/bug-report/issues)

Automation testing of UI:
UI automation test is located in ui-testing.py. For this automation I used Python language with Selenium webdriver. More information about installation and running the test can be found in instructions-python.txt file

Automation of API:
For API automation testing I used a Postman collection with assertions. You can find the file with Scripts in the file "QA CHallenge-Master.zhanar.json". Please import the file to check it in Postman
